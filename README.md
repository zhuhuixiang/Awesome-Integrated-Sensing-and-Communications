| [Integrated Sensing and Communications: Towards Dual-functional Wireless Networks for 6G and Beyond](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9737357)  | Fan Liu et al., SUSTech | JSAC 2022 | <details><summary>Abstract</summary> As the standardization of 5G is being solidified,  researchers are speculating what 6G will be. Integrating sensing  functionality is emerging as a key feature of the 6G Radio Access  Network (RAN), allowing to exploit the dense cell infrastructure  of 5G for constructing a perceptive network. In this paper, we  provide a comprehensive overview on the background, range of  key applications and state-of-the-art approaches of Integrated  Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We commence by discussing  the interplay between sensing and communications (S&C)  from a historical point of view, and then consider multiple facets  of ISAC and its performance gains. By introducing both ongoing  and potential use cases, we shed light on industrial progress and  standardization activities related to ISAC. We analyze a number  of performance tradeoffs between S&C, spanning from information  theoretical limits, tradeoffs in physical layer performance,  to the tradeoff in cross-layer designs. Next, we discuss signal  processing aspects of ISAC, namely ISAC waveform design and  receive signal processing. As a step further, we provide our vision  on the deeper integration between S&C within the framework of  perceptive networks, where the two functionalities are expected  to mutually assist each other, i.e., communication-assisted sensing  and sensing-assisted communications. Finally, we summarize the  paper by identifying the potential integration between ISAC and  other emerging communication technologies, and their positive  impact on the future of wireless networks.</details> |
